Hello, I am TYKUHN2, I have been programming for a long time, and program a wide array of projects, some open source.

If you wish to help with any projects, or just get in touch for any other reason, you can reach me at contact@tyknet.xyz
or here in this repository's [discussion board](https://github.com/TYKUHN2/TYKUHN2/discussions).

Alternatively, you can contact me at [@tykuhn2@mastodon.world](https://mastodon.world/@tykuhn2) or [@tykuhn2:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/)

Additional note: I activated vigilant mode on 4/15/2022. Commits prior to this will be unverified, though most will be done through SSH with a secure keypair so it's largely moot.
