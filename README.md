Hello, I am TYKUHN2, I have been programming for a long time, and program a wide array of projects, some open source.

If you wish to help with any projects, or just get in touch for any other reason, you can reach me at contact@tyknet.ml, my public twitter [@tykuhn3](https://twitter.com/tykuhn3),
or here in this repository's [discussion board](https://github.com/TYKUHN2/TYKUHN2/discussions).

Additional note: I activated vigilant mode on 4/15/2022. Commits prior to this will be unverified, though most will be done through SSH with a secure keypair so it's largely moot.
